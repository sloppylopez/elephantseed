### Application Home page
[https://docker.nginx.node.com](#https://docker.nginx.node.com)

### Workflow example

#### Run app on NodeJS server in local
    1)npm run clean:docker
    2)npm start:reload
    3)Open browser at http://docker.nginx.node.com:8080/

### Pitfalls
In case you see this message:

         Updating registry cache...
         Looking up github:twbs/bootstrap
         Downloading github:twbs/bootstrap@3.3.1
    
    err  Error downloading github:twbs/bootstrap
    
         GitHub rate limit reached. To increase the limit use GitHub authentication.
         Run jspm endpoint config github to set this up.
    
    warn Installation changes not saved.

You will need to pass your JSPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN to the seed, to do so just type:

```bash
$ jspm registry export github
```

And copy the value of registries.github.auth in Dockerfile <JSPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN>  
Notice that you will need a global jspm installed in your HOST machine do do this task

More info can be found here regarding tokens and authentication
